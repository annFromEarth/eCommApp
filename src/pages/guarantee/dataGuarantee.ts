  'We guarantee your plants will arrive in happy, healthy condition. If not, we replace them for free as part of our 30-Day Customer Happiness Guarantee. It’s natural for live plants to show minor signs of stress after transit but if the damage is beyond minor blemishes*, reach out to us within 30 days of receipt to receive a free replacement.',
  'The guarantee applies to all online and in-store purchases within the first 30 days. We require photos as proof of damage and to help us improve our packaging process. You can also bring an online order into any of our shops for a replacement. Inventory online and in-store differs, so we recommend calling your closest shop in advance to ensure availability.',
  'Remember, it’s natural for live plants to show minor signs of stress after transit. You can help your plant perk up from its journey by gently pruning any foliage damaged during the shipping process, such as bent stems or yellow leaves. Removing damaged foliage gives your plant back energy for new, healthy growth.',
